# Physics-aid-tool (My head Hertz)

This project was handed in as part of the IB Diploma Program and therefore cannot be open source. Instead, a video is added below providing a detailed walk through of the project.

**Technology Stack**: Python (including various libraries such as scikit-learn and pygame) & SQL

**Short Summary:** This project involves creating a physics help tool that can be used within the classroom. This involves a place for a teacher to store, view, edit and delete multiple choice questions. The tool also uses training data, collected from the client's classroom, to train a supervised learning algorithm (a decision tree) to predict a questions difficulty and thereby provide students with challenging yet manageable questions. The software also enables the creation of quizzes using questions from the database (and recommended by the machine learning algorithm). The program also includes timers, allows for freehand drawings, and includes a general 'home' to base lessons around.
